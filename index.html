    <h3>Challenge 1A: Potentiometers</h3>

    <p>
        The purpose of the potentiometers is to change different variables such as speed, P, I, and D without re-uploading code.
        To the right are the resistance values of each potentiometer.
        However, we decided to exclude the potentiometers in favor of realtime dynamic PID adjustment based on speed and curvature.

    <h3>Challenge 1B: Photoresistors</h3>
    <img src="c1/IMG_0277.jpg">
    <img src="c1/IMG_0278.jpg">
    <p>The photoresistors are set up in conjunction with voltage dividers to change resistance depending on the amount of light introduced to the sensors.
        To the right is an image of the Serial Monitor which prints the different light level values read by each photoresistor over time.</p>

    <h3>Challenge 1C: Motor Board</h3>

    <p>The motor shield is connected to the Arduino which acts as a power source. 
        It helps control direction and speed of the motor through Arduino.</p>

    <h3> Challenge 1D: CADing the Chassis</h3>

        <p>
            We developed a multi-functional chassis.
            Its purposes include holding the LEDs, photoresistors, and protoboard, as well as acting as a light shield. 
            However, we concluded that the light from the LEDs was so bright that ambient light/shadows would have marginal effects on the light level read by the photoresistors. 
            Hence, the light shield is simply an extra precaution taken to ensure that our robot runs properly.
